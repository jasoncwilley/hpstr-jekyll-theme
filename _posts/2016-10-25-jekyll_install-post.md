### Body text

Over the past few months I have spent countless hours scouring the web for tutorials that will help solidigy my web develoment skills. The internet is a great place for learning and offers a ton of free tutorials, guidance and advice on just about anything you could ever ponder but I quickly found out not all web tutorials are created equal.  In light of this I thought I'd take the time to create a few simple tutorials that may help other web developers steer clear of google rabbit holes and stackoverflow loops.

Before I start (and before you comment) I'd like to say that like anything else in life there are many ways to reach any desired end and that I am going to focus on what worked for me. If you choose to provide constructive criticism please take the time to explain why feel the way you do about the issue so we all can learn. OK, let's get started. If you wanna create a simplistic but powerful blog like this one the first thing you are are going to have to do is make sure you have the tools to do the job. To create a blog like this one you will need to have the following programs installed.


## Jekyll Dependencies 

* Ruby (including development headers, v1.9.3+ for Jekyll 2 and v2+ for Jekyll 3)
* RubyGems
* NodeJS or another JavaScript runtime (Jekyll 2 and earlier, for CoffeeScript support)
* Python 2.7 (for Jekyll 2 and earlier) or Python 3+ for Jekyll 3+)

First you will need to check and see if you have Ruby installed. Open your terminal and run.

```
userone@laptop:~/Desktop/$ ruby -v
ruby 2.3.0p0 (2015-12-25 revision 53290) [x86_64-linux]

```
